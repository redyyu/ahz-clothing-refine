## Develop

The masks, `Jacket/Masks` is patch for Vanilla mask bugs.
the original `Head` mask is too much extands to covered right feet,
seems is not did on purpose. because original shoes is big and fat, 
but custom shoes will see the problem. fix it by modified the mask.

if with instep mask (like the feet part in `Shoes/masks/heels`) on some clothingItem (bodylocation before `Shoes`).
the instep will show. but it will cause many other problems. such as masks 8 and 10 will show instep anyway.

anyway, if move `Shoes` before others, 
that's most easy way to mask shoes but show instep and mask other part of feets.
